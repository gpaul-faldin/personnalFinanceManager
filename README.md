So this project is my learning project for Java.

The goal of it is to handle multiple users and make cool visualisation of your finance with your input and output of cash with different categories.

I might use echarts or similar when I have a better understanding of Swing.

Appart from that, I liked that Java experiment but I'm far from being fluent for reading or writing Java code
